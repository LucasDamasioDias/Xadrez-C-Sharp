# Chess Project in C\#

This repository contains a study project developed by Professor Nelio Alves as part of a .NET course. The project is a simple chess game implemented in C# to explore object-oriented programming concepts and C# features.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project include:

- Understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#.
- Implementing game logic using classes and inheritance.
- Exploring exception handling and board validation.
- Developing a console-based chess game.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

## Project Features

- Fully functional chess game with:
  - Piece movement validation.
  - Capture mechanics.
  - Check and checkmate detection.
  - Console-based user interface.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LucasDamasioDias/Xadrez-C-Sharp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Xadrez-C-Sharp
   ```

3. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `Board/` - Contains the board and piece logic.
- `Chess/` - Implements the specific rules of chess.
- `Program.cs` - Entry point for running the game.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of Professor Nelio Alves' .NET course and serves as an excellent learning resource for anyone interested in object-oriented programming and game development in C#.
